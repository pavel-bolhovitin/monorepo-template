# README.md

- **Keep it minimal** — only what's needed so anyone can read it quickly. No extra sections or long explanations.
- **Commands** — put each command in its own code block (its own ` ```bash ` box) for easy copying.
- **Language**: Write content in **English** only, unless the user's requirements explicitly ask for another language.
